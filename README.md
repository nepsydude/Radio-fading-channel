In this computational exercise, the fundamentals of a simple radio system and the fundamentals of a 
simple radio system are discussed, with diversity and space multiplex options using a numerical computer 
algebra system. For this purpose, the individual components of the system,  the transmitter, 
a radio channel and a receiver, are simulated on the computer.
